# Predicting Personal Loan Acceptance Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer using machine learning. By analyzing customer demographic and behavioral data, the goal is to improve targeted marketing, optimize outreach, and increase loan acceptance rates. The project evaluates multiple classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes—to identify the best-performing model for real-world deployment.
